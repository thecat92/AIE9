## 👋 Welcome 
Welcome to [The AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp) Docs.

**`Docs` typically indicate the place where you can find additional useful information on the stuff you're trying to build.** 

That's what these docs are for, too! Here's the useful stuff you'll find inside:

## Session Sheets
`Session_Sheets` each contain everything you need to understand _what will be_ and _what was_ covered within each session.

Over 10 weeks, we'll have 20 sessions, as in our [Course Schedule & Curriculum](https://www.notion.so/The-AI-Engineering-Bootcamp-Course-Schedule-Curriculum-v0-9-2b1cd547af3d8075a0a4f67621f18898).

**Before class**, you should read the appropriate `Session_Sheet`. It contains useful information about what we're doing, why, and how you can best prepare to make the most out of your in-class experience!

**After class**, in addition to the useful information, you can access all **📚 Course Materials** directly from the Session Sheet, as you can through [`00_AIE_Quicklinks`](../00_AIE_Quicklinks/README.md).

## Prerequisite Materials
We have **📚 Course Materials** delivered during [The AI Engineer Onramp, Cohort 2](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-onramp). 

If you do _not have experience building end-to-end applications__, or you _did not **really** understand [The AI Engineer Challenge](https://aimakerspace.io/aie-challenge) when you completed it_, these may be useful to you.

Otherwise, if you're a senior software engineering professional, these will not be as useful.

There is NO ML-specific information in the prerequisite materials, as our work as AI Engineers is much more akin to that of software engineers than it is to that of data scientists. At least, for now...
