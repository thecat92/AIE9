# 🤖 Branch Development with Coding Agents

In the age of coding agents like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/), [Devin](https://devin.ai/), [Manus](https://manus.im/), and others, doing software engineering using branch development, according to professional Gitflow best practices, is easier than ever!

This is thanks to our ability to leverage [Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules) - in other words, system-level instructions - when using our coding agents.

As we’ll see throughout the course, the first set of Rules we want to set up in Cursor is the `.gitflow_rules` file in our project root, which uses exactly the commands we just reviewed above!

We can get a better understanding of system-level instructions and how they work by learning how to engage directly with Large Language Model APIs.

> ‼️ Even though it is tempting to simply use Cursor Rules all the time, if you really want to be an AI Engineer, you MUST NEVER hand over the reigns to cursor. In effect, when you do this, you are automating your own job, and it is only a matter of time until the company rightly sees you as obsolete.

Rather, ask yourself “If the CTO came to my desk and asked me to explain a piece of code that I have written, could I?”

If the answer is always yes, your job is much more likely to be safe in the age of automation.
