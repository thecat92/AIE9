## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) installed (or Visual Studio Code)
- A [GitHub](http://github.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (free tier works great!)
- Node.js installed on your computer (Mac: `brew install node`, Windows: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`)
- Git installed and configured
- SSH keys set up for GitHub (see Step 4)

---

## Step 1: Brainstorm Your Idea 💡

First, you need an idea for your app! You have two options:

**Option A: Use v0 for brainstorming**
- Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
- Use the chat to explore ideas and get suggestions

**Option B: Use ChatGPT (Recommended)**
- Ask ChatGPT to help you brainstorm app ideas
- Get feedback on your concept
- Refine your idea until you're happy with it

**Some ideas to get you started:**
- Personal portfolio website
- Task management app
- Weather dashboard
- Recipe finder
- Habit tracker
- Quote generator
- Simple calculator with style
- Todo list with categories

---

## Step 2: Get Your Design Resources 🎨

Now it's time to gather design inspiration and components. You have two paths:

#### Path A: Use v0's Premade Templates
- Browse v0's template library
- Pick a template that matches your vision

#### Path B: Create Your Own Design (More Original!)

**a) Pick a Template Style:**
- Visit [Canva Templates](https://www.canva.com/templates/)
- Find a design style you like
- Note the colors, layout, and overall aesthetic

**b) Choose Component Styles:**
- Go to [shadcn/ui Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/)
- Browse the component library
- Pick components that match your app's needs (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)

**c) Select a Color Scheme:**
- Visit [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- Generate or browse color palettes
- Pick colors that match your app's mood and purpose

---

## Step 3: Create Your v0 Prompt 🎬

Now combine everything into a detailed prompt for v0:

1. Describe your app idea
2. Reference the template style you chose
3. Mention the shadcn/ui components you want to use
4. Include your color scheme
5. Add any specific features or requirements

**Example prompt structure:**
```
Create me an app: [Your App Name]

[Description of your app concept]

Use the design style similar to: [Canva template reference]
For components, use shadcn/ui with: [component names]
Color scheme: [your colors from Coolors]
```

**Example: "Santa Wish List" App**

```
Create me a simple react.js frontend: 1. Santa’s Magical Wish List GeneratorVibe: Scroll parchment, snowflakes falling, warm candle glow.How it worksUser types a wish (or multiple wishes).Each item magically writes itself onto an animated parchment scroll with calligraphy.A wax seal “stamps” when the list is complete.A Ho Ho Ho sound or soft bell plays when Santa replies.Fun features❄️ Snowfall animation✍️ Auto-writing effect🕯 Cozy Christmas aesthetic🎁 Santa gives rating: “Nice / Naughty” for each wish.

Design Requirements:
- Use the website style similar to: https://www.canva.com/templates/EAFSoi3Ltnc/
- For buttons, use shadcn/ui with outline variant
- Color scheme: (select christmas colors from coolors.co)
- use image (upload cool_santa.png)
```

## Step 4: Set Up Your Development Environment 🛠️

Before we start building, we need to ensure your development environment is properly configured. Follow the comprehensive guide at [Interactive Dev Environment for LLM Development](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Interactive-Dev-Environment-for-LLM-Development?tab=readme-ov-file#rocket-lets-get-started).

### Key Setup Steps:

1. **Install Required Tools:**
   - Git
   - Node.js and npm
   - Cursor (or VS Code)
   - Terminal/Command Line Interface

2. **Set Up SSH Keys for GitHub:**
   - Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
   - Copy your public key:
     - Mac: `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
     - Windows (WSL): `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
     - Linux: `xclip -sel c < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH Key

3. **Configure Git:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   - **Security Note**: If you configure API keys, store them in a `.env` file (already in [.gitignore](/.gitignore#L138)) to protect sensitive data.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Important:** Make sure you complete the full environment setup from the guide before proceeding. This ensures you have all the tools and configurations needed for professional development.

## Step 5: Connect to AIM Repository Remotely 🔗
- Clone the AIEO2 repo into your local folder by following the steps in [Setting up local repo](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE8/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)

Now we'll set up a connection to the AI Maker Space repository so you can access course materials while maintaining your own repository.

### 5.1 Create and Clone Your GitHub Repository

1. First, create a new repository on GitHub (we'll do this in detail in Step 6, but for now):
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Copy the SSH URL of your repository

2. Clone your empty repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git
   cd yourrepo
   ```

> **Note:** If you see `warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.` - that's perfect! You've done it correctly.

### 5.2 Add AIM Repository as Upstream Remote

1. Add the AI Maker Space repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/AIEO2.git
   ```

2. Verify your remotes:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   origin    git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git (fetch)
   origin    git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git (push)
   upstream  git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/AIEO2.git (fetch)
   upstream  git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/AIEO2.git (push)
   ```

3. Fetch content from upstream:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```

4. Make changes, add them and commit them
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m your-message
   ```

5. Push to your repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

6. Next time before making any changes:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

**Why this setup?** This pattern allows you to:
- Keep your own repository for your work
- Pull updates from the course repository when needed
- Maintain a clean separation between course materials and your projects

---

## Step 6: Create Your GitHub Repository 🐙

Now let's create a dedicated repository for your frontend application.

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Name your repository (e.g., `my-v0-app` or `my-ai-frontend`)
5. Choose **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
6. Add .gitignore (Python), license (you can select - for copyrights, i.e. MIT)
7. Click **"Create repository"**
8. **Copy the SSH URL** (click the green "Code" button and select SSH, then copy the URL)
   - It should look like: `git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git`
   - You'll need this SSH link in Step 7!

**Why start with GitHub?** Setting up version control first ensures you can track all changes from the very beginning and makes deployment seamless.

## Step 7: Clone Repository and Download v0 App in Cursor 📥

### 7.1 Clone Your GitHub Repository in Cursor

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette
3. Type **"Git: Clone"** and select it
4. Paste your SSH repository URL (from Step 6)
5. Choose a location to clone the repository
6. Cursor will open a **new window** with your cloned repository

**You now have your GitHub repository open in Cursor!**

### 7.2 Download Your App from v0

1. In v0, after generating your app, click **"Download"**
2. Copy the **npx command** (it should look like: `npx create-v0-app@latest`)
3. In Cursor's terminal (in the cloned repository window), run the npx command from v0:
   ```bash
   npx create-v0-app@latest
   ```
   *(Paste the exact command from v0)*

4. Follow the prompts if any appear
5. This will create your app folder with all the code in your repository
### 7.3 Install Dependencies

1. In Cursor's terminal, navigate to your app directory:
   ```bash
   cd app  # or the folder name v0 created
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   **If you encounter errors:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### 7.4 Run Your App Locally

1. In Cursor's terminal, navigate to your app directory:
   ```bash
   cd app  # or the folder name v0 created
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Look for a local URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in the terminal

4. Open the URL in your browser

5. Verify your app is working correctly!

**If port 3000 is in use:**
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -ti tcp:3000)
```

### 7.5 Generate README with Cursor 🤖

Let Cursor help you create documentation:

1. In Cursor, ask: *"Create a README.md file explaining how to launch this app"*
2. Cursor will analyze your project structure
3. It will generate a README with setup and launch instructions
4. Review and customize as needed

### 7.6 Commit and Push to GitHub

Since you cloned the repository, it's already connected to GitHub! Now commit your v0 app:

1. In Cursor's terminal, make sure you're in the repository root (not the app folder)
2. Add all files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Create your first commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: v0 generated frontend"
   ```

4. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. Go to your GitHub repository and verify all files are there! 🎉

## Step 8: Deploy to Vercel 🌐

Now let's get your app live on the web!

1. Go to terminal inside of your frontend folder and type in `vercel --prod`

**Your app is now live and accessible to the world!** 🎉

**What just happened?**
- Vercel automatically detected your Next.js/React framework
- It built your app in the cloud
- It deployed it to a global CDN
- Every time you push to `main`, Vercel will automatically redeploy!

---

## 🏗️ Activity: Experiment with Your App

Now it's your turn to experiment and get creative! Use this time to practice what you've learned and explore the tools.

**Experiment with Design Customization:**
- Test out different background styles and color schemes
- Try different button styles and components from shadcn/ui
- Make design changes using v0 to see how it generates updated code
- Practice iterating on your app's visual design

**Try Making Changes:**
- Use Cursor's AI to add a new feature
- Ask Cursor to improve the styling
- Add a new component or section
- Experiment with different layouts

**Remember:**
- Test locally with `npm run dev` before pushing changes
- Commit your changes: `git add .` then `git commit -m "your message"`
- Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
- Watch Vercel automatically redeploy your changes!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### npm install errors

If you encounter an `npm install` error:

1. Install with legacy peer deps:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Uninstall `vaul` (problematic peer dependency in some templates):
   ```bash
   npm uninstall vaul
   ```

3. Commit the resulting dependency updates:
   ```bash
   git add package.json package-lock.json
   git commit -m "fix: resolve dependency conflicts"
   git push
   ```

4. Redeploy on Vercel. The build should now pass.

### Port 3000 in use

If port 3000 is in use:
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -ti tcp:3000)
```

### Git push errors

If you get authentication errors:
- Make sure your SSH key is added to GitHub
- Verify your remote URL: `git remote -v`
- Try using HTTPS instead: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git`

### Vercel deployment fails

- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify your `package.json` has a `build` script
- Check that your framework is supported by Vercel
