<summary><strong>🎯 Advanced Assignment: Multi-Persona Chat with CV Context</strong></summary>

Enhance your Wish List App with advanced features that allow users to chat with different personas and provide context about themselves through a CV upload.

### Features to Implement

1. **Three Chat Personas**
   - **St. Nicholas** (default) - The jolly, wise Santa character
   - **Angel** - A kind, encouraging persona
   - **Devil** - A mischievous, playful persona
   
2. **PDF CV Upload**
   - Allow users to upload their CV in PDF format
   - Extract text from the PDF
   - Include CV content in the system prompt so the persona knows about the user

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Update Backend to Support Multiple Personas

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 Click to see Cursor AI prompt for backend updates</strong></summary>

```
Update my FastAPI backend to support multiple chat personas. I need:
1. An endpoint that accepts a "character" parameter (options: "nicholas", "angel", "devil")
2. Each persona should have a unique system prompt that defines their personality
3. The endpoint should be POST /api/chat with body: {"message": "text", "character": "nicholas|angel|devil"}
4. Reference the Session 02 codebase for persona system prompts if available
```

</details>

#### Step 2: Add PDF Upload Endpoint

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 Click to see Cursor AI prompt for PDF upload</strong></summary>

```
Add PDF upload functionality to my FastAPI backend:
1. Create a POST endpoint /api/upload-cv that accepts a PDF file
2. Extract text from the uploaded PDF using a library like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
3. Store the extracted text (you can use session storage or return it to frontend)
4. Include the CV text in the system prompt when chatting with personas
5. Reference Session 02 codebase for PDF upload implementation if available
```

</details>

#### Step 3: Update Frontend with Persona Selector

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 Click to see Cursor AI prompt for persona selector</strong></summary>

```
Update my Next.js frontend to:
1. Add a persona selector (dropdown or buttons) with three options: St. Nicholas, Angel, Devil
2. Update the chat API call to include the selected character parameter
3. Display the selected persona's name/icon in the chat interface
4. Style it to match the existing Christmas theme
```

</details>

#### Step 4: Add PDF Upload UI

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 Click to see Cursor AI prompt for PDF upload UI</strong></summary>

```
Add a PDF upload button to my Next.js frontend:
1. Create a file input that accepts only PDF files
2. Add an upload button near the chat interface
3. Show upload progress and success/error messages
4. Call the /api/upload-cv endpoint when a file is selected
5. Store the CV content for use in subsequent chat messages
6. Reference Session 02 codebase for PDF upload UI implementation if available
```

</details>

#### Step 5: Integrate CV Context into Chat

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 Click to see Cursor AI prompt for CV integration</strong></summary>

```
Update the chat functionality to include CV context:
1. When a CV is uploaded, include its text in the system prompt
2. Modify the chat API call to send CV context along with the message
3. Ensure the persona responses are personalized based on the user's CV
4. Handle cases where no CV is uploaded (chat should still work)
```

</details>

### Technical Requirements

**Backend:**
- Install PDF processing library: `pip install PyPDF2` or `pip install pdfplumber`
- Update FastAPI endpoint to handle file uploads
- Extract text from PDF and include in system prompt

**Frontend:**
- Add file input component for PDF upload
- Implement file upload with progress indication
- Add persona selector UI component
- Update API calls to include character and CV context

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can select different personas and see personality differences in responses
- [ ] Can upload a PDF CV successfully
- [ ] Chat responses reference information from the uploaded CV
- [ ] Chat works without CV upload (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Error handling for invalid file types or upload failures
- [ ] UI matches the existing Christmas theme

### Reference

These features were implemented in **Session 02**. Review that codebase for:
- Persona system prompts and character definitions
- PDF upload and text extraction implementation
- File upload UI components

### Getting Help

If you need assistance:
1. Ask Cursor AI agents with specific prompts (see above)
2. Reference Session 02 codebase for implementation examples
3. Test each feature independently before integrating
4. Check browser console and backend logs for errors

</details>

<summary><strong>🐛 Troubleshooting & Debugging Tips</strong></summary>

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. React Version Mismatch Warnings

**Problem:** You see npm warnings like:
```
npm warn Could not resolve dependency:
npm warn peer react@"^19.2.1" from react-dom@19.2.1
npm warn node_modules/react-dom
npm warn   react@"19.2.0" from the root project
```

**Cause:** Your `package.json` has `react@19.2.0` but `react-dom@19.2.1` requires `react@^19.2.1`. This version mismatch can cause peer dependency warnings and potential runtime issues.

**Solution:**
1. Open your `package.json` file in the frontend directory
2. Update both React and React DOM to the same version (preferably the latest matching version):
   ```json
   "react": "19.2.1",
   "react-dom": "19.2.1",
   ```
3. Run `npm install` to update the dependencies
4. The warnings should disappear after the installation completes

**Why this happens:** When v0 generates a frontend, it may use slightly different versions of React packages. Always ensure `react` and `react-dom` versions match exactly to avoid peer dependency conflicts.

#### 2. Environment Variables Not Working

**Problem:** Frontend can't connect to backend, or API calls fail.

**Solution:**
- Check that `.env.local` exists in your frontend root directory
- Verify the variable name starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Restart your dev server after changing environment variables
- In Vercel, ensure environment variables are set in the project settings (not just locally)

#### 3. CORS Errors

**Problem:** Browser console shows CORS errors when frontend tries to call backend.

**Solution:**
- Verify your backend has CORS middleware configured (should already be in the template)
- Check that `allow_origins=["*"]` is set in your FastAPI CORS middleware
- Ensure your frontend URL is allowed in production (or use `["*"]` for development)

#### 4. Backend Not Starting

**Problem:** `uvicorn` command fails or backend doesn't respond.

**Solution:**
- Check that you're in the correct directory (`backend-wish-list`)
- Verify your `.env` file exists and contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Ensure Python dependencies are installed: `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 8000 is already in use: `lsof -i :8000` (macOS/Linux) or change the port

#### 5. Frontend Build Fails on Vercel

**Problem:** Vercel deployment fails during build step.

**Solution:**
- Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
- Verify `package.json` has all required dependencies
- Ensure Node.js version is compatible (check Vercel settings)
- Look for TypeScript errors or missing imports in the build logs
- Try building locally first: `npm run build` to catch errors early

#### 6. API Calls Return 404 or 500 Errors

**Problem:** Frontend makes requests but gets error responses.

**Solution:**
- Verify the backend URL is correct in your environment variables
- Test the backend endpoint directly using curl or Postman
- Check backend logs (Vercel function logs) for error details
- Ensure the endpoint path matches exactly (`/api/chat` not `/api/chat/`)
- Verify request body format matches what the backend expects

#### 7. Images Not Loading

**Problem:** Santa image or other assets don't display.

**Solution:**
- Verify images are in `public/images/` directory
- Check file paths in your code match the actual file locations
- Ensure image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- For Next.js, use `/images/filename.png` (leading slash, no `public` in path)

### General Debugging Workflow

1. **Read the error message carefully** - Most errors contain helpful information
2. **Check the browser console** - Frontend errors appear here
3. **Check terminal output** - Backend errors appear in your terminal or Vercel logs
4. **Test components individually** - Test backend separately, then frontend, then together
5. **Use Cursor AI agents** - Ask for help with specific error messages
6. **Check versions** - Ensure all package versions are compatible
7. **Clear caches** - Try `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install` for frontend issues

### Getting Help

If you're stuck:
- Copy the exact error message and ask Cursor AI agents for help
- Check Vercel deployment logs for detailed error information
- Verify each step was completed correctly by reviewing the instructions
- Test locally before deploying to catch issues early
