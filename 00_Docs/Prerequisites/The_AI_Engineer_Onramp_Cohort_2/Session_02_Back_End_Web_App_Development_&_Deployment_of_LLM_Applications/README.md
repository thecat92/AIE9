## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Cursor IDE
- GitHub account
- Vercel account
- uv (Python package manager)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (set as an environment variable in Vercel)
- Optional: Vercel CLI (only if deploying from terminal):
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  ```

## Project Setup Files

You'll need to create the following configuration files:
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration with dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies (for Vercel deployment)
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

See the [Assignment](./Assignment.md) for detailed instructions on setting up these files.

## Tools and Frameworks

In today's code, we also use several new tools and frameworks:
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/)
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/main-concepts) 

Note: You are **not expected or required** to know these yet; this list is simply here for reference and exploration.

# Build 🏗️

In this session, you'll build a Python FastAPI backend called **TreatOrHell** (Holiday Edition), add LLM chat endpoints for St. Nicholas, an Angel, and a Devil, optionally add document analysis (PDF/CSV), and deploy to Vercel. Advanced: generate a frontend in v0 and connect it to your backend.

- 🤝 [Assignment](./Assignment.md)
    - Set up environment and create FastAPI
    - Add LLM chat endpoints with different personas (St. Nicholas, Angel, Devil)
    - Test locally and deploy to Vercel
    - Advanced: generate a frontend in v0, connect to backend, deploy frontend

# Ship 🚢

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Modules (OPTIONAL) — <i>open for details</i></summary>

**Advanced Backend: Add Student Questions & Context Awareness**
- Create a form/endpoint that collects 4 student questions about their assignment handling, help-seeking behavior, class engagement, and time spent
- Save the responses to a text file (e.g., `student_responses.txt`)
- Update your `/chat/angel` endpoint to read from the saved responses file
- Include the student's answers in the LLM system prompt so the Angel can personalize responses based on the student's behavior
- Iterate locally, then re-deploy

**Advanced Frontend (v0):**
- Generate a frontend with v0 that calls your backend (e.g., `POST /chat/angel`, `/chat/nicholas`, `/chat/devil`)
- Connect via fetch and deploy the frontend to Vercel

### Deliverables

- A short Loom video of either:
  - Your deployed TreatOrHell backend (and optional frontend) showcasing the features you built
  - A walkthrough of your GitFlow + multi-agent workflow
  - Your advanced module (student questions & context awareness or v0 frontend)

# Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

🎁 Exciting News! 🎁

I just built and deployed TreatOrHell — a holiday-themed FastAPI backend with AI-powered chat! Chat with St. Nicholas, an Angel, or a Devil using OpenAI's API! 🧑‍🎄👼😈

🔍 Three Key Takeaways:

1️⃣ FastAPI makes building Python backends fast and fun — perfect for LLM-powered applications

2️⃣ GitFlow and feature branching enable clean, organized development workflows

3️⃣ Vercel makes serverless deployment seamless — from code to production in minutes!

Built with FastAPI, OpenAI API, and deployed on Vercel. The app features three unique AI personas, each with their own personality and response style!
