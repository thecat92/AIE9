# 📛 Required **Tooling & Account Setup**

In addition to the tools we've already learned, in this session you'll need:
    
1. Create a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account

# **🧑‍💻 Recommended Pre-Work**

**Goal**: Understand what an “agent” is and how to use the latest abstractions for building production-grade agents fast

**Learning Outcomes**
- Understand agents and the foundational agent loop
- Learn the core constructs of LangChain
- Learn the key components of building agents in LangChain, including create_agent and middleware

**New Tools**
- Orchestration: [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview)
- Vector Database: [QDrant](https://github.com/qdrant)
- Monitoring: [LangSmith Observability ](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability)
