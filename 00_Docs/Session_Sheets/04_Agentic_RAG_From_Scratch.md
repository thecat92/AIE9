## 🕸️  Core Constructs: LangGraph

The essence of LangGraph is that it uses graphs to add cycles.  

**Why Cycles?**

We can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application ***agent-forward*** while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.

Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.

**Why LangGraph?**

During this session, *we will be using LangGraph as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG*).  Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional DAG chains with powerful cyclic behavior due to the tight integration with LCEL. 

In this way, LangGraph is a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!

## Graphs

Graphs are collections of connected objects: nodes and edges.

- **Node**: Think `function` or `runnable`; i.e. *something that changes **state***
- **Edge**: Think path to take; i.e., *where to pass **state** object next*

A state object is initially defined by passing a state definition to a class representing the graph.  This state object, or `StateGraph`, gets updated over time.  The agent's internal state is represented simply as a list of messages.  Remember how we interacted with the OpenAI API with a list of messages with roles?  Same idea.

Just as every component of a chain is a runnable, each node in our graph can be a runnable, or even an entire chain!  

Welcome to the next layer of abstraction.
