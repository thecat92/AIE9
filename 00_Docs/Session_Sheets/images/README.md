## Images for Sessions

This folder contains image assets used by the reading materials in each Session of the `00_Docs` directory.

The images support written concepts, diagrams, and code explanations found in the docs, and are referenced directly from markdown files where needed.

### What belongs here

* Diagrams and visual explanations of concepts
* Screenshots or visual aids related to code examples
* Figures used in documentation or learning materials

### What doesn’t belong here

* Raw datasets or generated outputs
* Experiment artifacts or logs
* Images unrelated to documentation or learning content

### Usage notes

* Keep filenames descriptive and readable
* Prefer stable image references to avoid breaking links in docs
* Organize images into subfolders if the collection grows

This folder exists solely to support clarity and learning within `00_Docs`.
