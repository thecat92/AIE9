    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

    "### Advantages of Supervisor-Researcher Delegation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Task Decomposition**\n",
    "   - Unlike section-based approaches with predefined structure, the supervisor can break down research based on the actual question\n",
    "   - Adapts to different types of research (comparisons, lists, deep dives, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",
    "   - Multiple researchers work simultaneously on different aspects\n",
    "   - Much faster than sequential section processing\n",
    "   - Configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReAct Pattern for Quality**\n",
    "   - Researchers use `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "   - Prevents excessive searching and improves search quality\n",
    "   - Natural stopping conditions based on information sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Tool Integration**\n",
    "   - Easy to add MCP tools for specialized research\n",
    "   - Supports multiple search APIs (Anthropic, Tavily)\n",
    "   - Each researcher can use different tool combinations\n",

    "5. **Graceful Token Limit Handling**\n",

    "## Task 10: Key Takeaways & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Decomposition** - Research structure emerges from the question, not predefined\n",
    "2. **Parallel Efficiency** - Multiple researchers work simultaneously\n",
    "3. **ReAct Quality** - Strategic reflection improves search decisions\n",
    "4. **Scalability** - Handles token limits gracefully through compression\n",
    "5. **Flexibility** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern\n",
    "- **Complex research questions** that need multi-angle investigation\n",
    "- **Comparison tasks** where parallel research on different topics is beneficial\n",
    "- **Open-ended exploration** where structure should emerge dynamically\n",
    "- **Time-sensitive research** where parallel execution speeds up results\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Section-Based Instead\n",
    "- **Highly structured reports** with predefined format requirements\n",
    "- **Template-based content** where sections are always the same\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies** where later sections depend on earlier ones\n",
    "- **Budget constraints** where token efficiency is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extend the System\n",
    "1. **Add MCP Tools** - Integrate specialized tools for your domain\n",
    "2. **Custom Prompts** - Modify prompts for specific research types\n",
    "3. **Different Models** - Try different Claude versions or mix models\n",
    "4. **Persistence** - Use a real database for checkpointing instead of memory\n",
