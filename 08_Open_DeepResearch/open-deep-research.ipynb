    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

    "### Advantages of Supervisor-Researcher Delegation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Task Decomposition**\n",
    "   - Unlike section-based approaches with predefined structure, the supervisor can break down research based on the actual question\n",
    "   - Adapts to different types of research (comparisons, lists, deep dives, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",
    "   - Multiple researchers work simultaneously on different aspects\n",
    "   - Much faster than sequential section processing\n",
    "   - Configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReAct Pattern for Quality**\n",
    "   - Researchers use `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "   - Prevents excessive searching and improves search quality\n",
    "   - Natural stopping conditions based on information sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Tool Integration**\n",
    "   - Easy to add MCP tools for specialized research\n",
    "   - Supports multiple search APIs (Anthropic, Tavily)\n",
    "   - Each researcher can use different tool combinations\n",

    "5. **Graceful Token Limit Handling**\n",

    "### Phase 1: Clarification\n",
    "The system checked if your request was clear. Since you provided specific details about your sleep issues, it likely proceeded without asking clarifying questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Research Brief\n",
    "Your request was transformed into a detailed research brief that guides the supervisor's delegation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Supervisor Delegation\n",
    "The supervisor analyzed the brief and decided how to break down the research:\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to plan strategy\n",
    "- Called `ConductResearch` to delegate to researchers\n",
    "- Each delegation specified a focused research topic (e.g., sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm, blue light effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Parallel Research\n",
    "Researchers worked on their assigned topics:\n",
    "- Each researcher used web search tools to gather information\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "- Decided when they had enough information\n",
    "- Compressed their findings into clean summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5: Final Report\n",

       "### Week 1-2: Foundation Phase\n",
       "**Frequency:** 4 rides per week\n",
       "**Duration:** \n",
       "- 3 rides at 25-30 minutes\n",
       "- 1 ride at 20 minutes (recovery ride)\n",
       "**Intensity Distribution:** 80% easy pace, 20% moderate effort\n",
       "**Progression:** Increase duration by 5 minutes from baseline while maintaining comfortable intensity\n",
       "\n",
       "Research indicates that beginner cyclists benefit from an initial adaptation period where volume increases gradually while intensity remains low to moderate. The polarized training model, which emphasizes high volumes of low-intensity training (Zone 1-2), has been shown to be particularly effective for developing aerobic capacity in recreational cyclists.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 3-4: Development Phase\n",
       "**Frequency:** 4 rides per week\n",
       "**Duration:**\n",
       "- 2 rides at 35-40 minutes\n",
       "- 1 ride at 30 minutes with structured intervals\n",
       "- 1 ride at 25 minutes (recovery ride)\n",
       "**Intensity Distribution:** 75% easy pace, 20% moderate effort, 5% higher intensity\n",
       "**Progression:** Introduction of brief tempo efforts (2-3 minutes) within longer rides\n",
       "\n",
       "Studies on cardiovascular conditioning demonstrate that incorporating moderate-intensity intervals after 2-3 weeks of base training optimizes aerobic adaptation while minimizing injury risk. The gradual introduction of structured efforts allows for physiological adaptation without overwhelming the musculoskeletal system.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 5-6: Consolidation Phase\n",
       "**Frequency:** 4 rides per week\n",
       "**Duration:**\n",
       "- 2 rides at 40-45 minutes\n",
       "- 1 ride at 35 minutes with intervals\n",
       "- 1 ride at 30 minutes (recovery ride)\n",
       "**Intensity Distribution:** 70% easy pace, 25% moderate effort, 5% higher intensity\n",
       "**Progression:** Longer sustained efforts (5-8 minutes) and one longer endurance ride\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on training periodization shows that consolidation phases help solidify fitness gains while preparing the body for future training loads. The emphasis remains on aerobic development with controlled exposure to higher intensities.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Zone 1 (Recovery/Easy Spin):** 50-60% HRR = 122-135 bpm\n",

       "\n",
       "### Perceived Exertion Guidelines\n",
       "Using the 1-10 RPE scale:\n",
       "- **Easy Spins (Zone 1-2):** RPE 3-5, conversational pace, nasal breathing possible\n",
       "- **Steady Efforts (Zone 2-3):** RPE 5-6, can speak in sentences, rhythmic breathing\n",
       "- **Short Challenges (Zone 3-4):** RPE 6-7, can speak few words, controlled deeper breathing\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "### Pre-Ride Dynamic Mobility (5-8 minutes)\n",
       "**Hip Circles:** 10 each direction\n",
       "- Forward and backward leg swings: 10 each leg\n",
       "- Thoracic spine rotations: 8 each direction\n",
       "- Cat-cow stretches: 10 repetitions\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on cycling-specific warm-up protocols shows that dynamic mobility exercises targeting the hip complex and thoracic spine significantly improve cycling performance and reduce lower back discomfort.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Post-Ride Static Stretching (8-10 minutes)\n",
       "**Hip Flexor Stretch:** 30 seconds each side\n",
       "- Seated forward fold: 45 seconds\n",
       "- Seated spinal twist: 30 seconds each side\n",
       "- Child's pose with side reach: 30 seconds each side\n",
       "- Supine knee-to-chest: 30 seconds each leg\n",
       "\n",
       "Studies demonstrate that post-exercise static stretching, particularly targeting hip flexors and spinal extensors, can reduce cycling-related lower back tension and improve recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Core Strengthening Program (3x per week, alternating with cycling days)\n",
       "**Week 1-2:**\n",
       "- Dead bug: 2 sets of 8 each side\n",
       "- Modified plank: 2 sets of 20-30 seconds\n",
       "- Bird dog: 2 sets of 8 each side\n",
       "- Glute bridge: 2 sets of 12\n",

       "\n",
       "Research on core stability training for cyclists demonstrates that exercises targeting deep stabilizing muscles, particularly the transverse abdominis and multifidus, significantly reduce lower back pain and improve cycling efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comprehensive Injury Prevention Strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "### Lower Back Prevention\n",
       "**Bike Fit Considerations:**\n",
       "- Saddle height should allow 25-30 degree knee bend at bottom of pedal stroke\n",
       "- Saddle setback positioned so knee tracks over pedal axle when cranks are horizontal\n",
       "- Handlebar height should not create excessive forward lean (>45 degrees initially)\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on cycling biomechanics shows that proper bike fit is the primary factor in preventing lower back pain, with saddle height and fore-aft position being critical parameters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Posture Cues During Riding:**\n",
       "- Maintain neutral spine position with slight forward lean\n",
       "- Engage core muscles gently throughout ride\n",
       "- Relax shoulders and avoid excessive grip tension\n",
       "- Change hand positions every 10-15 minutes\n",
       "\n",
       "### Hip and Hamstring Prevention\n",
       "**Specific Interventions:**\n",
       "- Daily hip flexor stretching (couch stretch or low lunge)\n",
       "- Hamstring mobility work 3x per week (standing forward fold, seated stretches)\n",
       "- Glute activation exercises before rides\n",
       "- Focus on full pedal stroke engagement\n",
       "\n",
       "Studies indicate that cycling's repetitive hip flexion can lead to adaptive shortening of hip flexors and hamstrings, making targeted mobility work essential for injury prevention.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Progressive Loading Principles\n",
       "- Increase weekly training volume by no more than 10%\n",
       "- Follow hard training days with easy or rest days\n",
       "- Include complete rest day every 7-10 days\n",
       "- Monitor morning heart rate variability as recovery indicator\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on training load management demonstrates that adherence to progressive loading principles reduces injury risk by up to 50% in recreational cyclists.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety Considerations and Warning Signs\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immediate Stop Indicators\n",
       "**Sharp, sudden pain in:**\n",
       "- Lower back (especially with radiation into legs)\n",
       "- Knee (anterior, medial, or posterior)\n",
       "- Neck or shoulders (indicating potential bike fit issues)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cardiovascular Warning Signs:**\n",
       "- Chest pain or pressure\n",
       "- Dizziness or lightheadedness\n",
       "- Irregular heartbeat\n",
       "- Excessive shortness of breath that doesn't resolve with reduced intensity\n",
       "\n",
       "### Reduce Training Indicators\n",
       "**Persistent muscle soreness lasting >48 hours**\n",
       "- Elevated resting heart rate (>10 bpm above normal for 2+ consecutive days)\n",
       "- General fatigue affecting daily activities\n",
       "- Sleep disturbances\n",
       "- Decreased motivation or enjoyment\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on overtraining syndrome shows that early recognition of these warning signs and appropriate training modification can prevent more serious complications.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recovery and Modification Guidelines\n",
       "**When experiencing minor lower back stiffness:**\n",
       "- Reduce ride duration by 25-30%\n",
       "- Focus on easier intensities (Zone 1-2 only)\n",
       "- Increase pre and post-ride mobility work\n",
       "- Consider bike fit assessment if symptoms persist >1 week\n",
       "\n",
       "**When experiencing general fatigue:**\n",
       "- Take an additional rest day\n",
       "- Reduce intensity while maintaining duration\n",
       "- Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours) and nutrition\n",
       "- Consider stress management techniques\n",
       "\n",
       "## Equipment and Environmental Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "### Essential Equipment for Back Health\n",
       "**Proper cycling shorts with chamois**\n",
       "- Well-fitted helmet to prevent neck strain\n",
       "- Multiple hand position options (drop bars or ergonomic grips)\n",
       "- Consider professional bike fit after 4-6 weeks of consistent riding\n",
       "\n",
       "### Environmental Factors\n",
       "**Weather considerations:**\n",
       "- Cold weather requires extended warm-up (10-15 minutes)\n",
       "- Hot weather necessitates increased hydration and intensity reduction\n",
       "- Wind conditions may require route modification to maintain target intensities\n",
       "\n",
       "Research demonstrates that environmental factors significantly impact exercise tolerance and injury risk, particularly for recreational cyclists who may be less accustomed to varying conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Monitoring and Progression Beyond 6 Weeks\n",
       "\n",
       "### Success Metrics\n",
       "**Objective Measures:**\n",
       "- Ability to maintain conversation during Zone 2 efforts\n",
       "- Completion of 45-minute rides without significant discomfort\n",
       "- Improved recovery between training sessions\n",
       "- Stable or improved morning heart rate\n",
       "\n",
       "**Subjective Measures:**\n",
       "- Increased confidence and enjoyment during rides\n",
       "- Reduced lower back stiffness post-ride\n",
       "- Enhanced energy levels throughout the day\n",
       "- Motivation to continue cycling\n",
       "\n",
       "### Long-term Progression Guidelines\n",
       "After completing this 6-week program, research suggests that recreational cyclists can safely:\n",
       "- Increase longest ride by 10-15 minutes every 2 weeks\n",
       "- Gradually introduce longer interval sessions (up to 15-20 minutes)\n",
       "- Consider participating in organized group rides or events\n",
       "- Explore different cycling disciplines (mountain biking, touring, etc.)\n",
