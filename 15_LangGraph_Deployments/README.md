### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.11+** installed
- An **OpenAI API Key**
- A **Tavily API Key**
- (Optional) **LangSmith** credentials for tracing

Create a `.env` file in this directory with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
   ```
2. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies.

# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API from a different terminal
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangSmith Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

>NOTE: This can be done in place of the Main Assignment

- Create and deploy a locally hosted MCP server with FastMCP.
- Extend your tools in `tools.py` to allow your LangGraph to consume the MCP Server.

When submitting, provide:
- Your Loom video link demonstrating the MCP server integration
- The GitHub URL to your completed Advanced Build

Have fun!

### Questions & Activities

#### Question 1:
What is the key architectural difference between the `simple_agent` and `agent_with_helpfulness` graphs? Specifically, explain how the helpfulness evaluation loop works and what mechanisms are in place to prevent it from running indefinitely.

##### Answer:



#### Question 2:
What is the role of `langgraph.json` in the LangGraph Deployments? Describe each of its key fields and how the platform uses this file to discover and serve your graphs.

##### Answer:



#### Activity #1:
Create your own agent graph! Build a new graph in `app/graphs/` with a custom evaluation node (e.g., a vibe checker, a fact verifier, a summarizer — get creative!). Register it in `langgraph.json`, serve it with `uv run langgraph dev`

# Submitting Your Homework

### Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:

1. Pull the latest updates from upstream into the main branch of your AIE9 repo:
    - _(You should have completed this process already.)_ For your initial repo setup, see [Initial_Setup](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE9 repo, run the following commands:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```
2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `15_LangGraph_Platform` folder (you can also use the _File -> Open Folder_ menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Answer Questions 1 - 2 using the `##### Answer:` markdown cell below them in the README
4. Complete Activity #1 in the README
5. Add, commit and push your modified files to your GitHub repository.

When submitting your homework, provide:
- Your Loom video link
- The GitHub URL to the `15_LangGraph_Platform` folder on your assignment branch
