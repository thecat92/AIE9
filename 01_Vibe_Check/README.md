## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: The system explains concepts clearly and accurately using simple, step-by-step logic. Abstract ideas are supported with concrete examples, making them easy to understand even for beginners.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: The system delivers concise summaries that capture the key points while removing unnecessary detail. Outputs focus on what is actionable and relevant, with a clear signal-over-noise approach.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: The system follows instructions closely, including tone and length constraints. Creative output remains coherent, natural, and aligned with the intended purpose.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: The system shows clear logical reasoning and correct arithmetic. Steps are transparent and easy to verify, reducing the risk of errors.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: The system adapts tone effectively while preserving the original meaning. Core ideas remain intact across different writing styles and audiences.

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer: The assistant consistently delivers high-quality outputs that meet the expectations of the prompts. Responses are logically sound, context-aware, and provide practical value to the user. Information is communicated clearly and efficiently, making the results suitable across a range of tasks, from explanatory and analytical responses to stylistic rewriting and structured reasoning.
 
---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of losing weight.
   - Result: The assistants response has an empathetic, balanced, and supportive vibe, acting like a wise therapeutic coach that promotes self-reflection without pressure. It excels at presenting pros/cons realistically, suggesting holistic alternatives, and encouraging personal values alignment for sustainable health decisions.
2. Prompt: Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a colleague from work who hasn't responded.
   - Result: The assistant delivers a practical, professional, and considerate vibe—like a reliable work-savvy colleague who provides ready-to-use templates across formats. It maintains polite brevity while offering flexibility, support offers, and clear next steps without pressure or impatience.
3. Prompt: Help me plan a birthday surprise for my son, he is 4 year old, likes Pokemon, Pepa Pig Tom and Jerry.
   - Result: The assistant exudes an enthusiastic, organized, and parent-friendly vibe—like a fun party planner aunt who delivers a low-stress, actionable blueprint tailored to a 4-year-old's loves. It balances creativity with practicality through structured timelines, budget hacks, safety tips, and custom questions, ensuring joy without overwhelm.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes, the vibes align well with mine—they're practical, structured, empathetic, and actionable, matching my methodical data engineering style and preference for clear, step-by-step guidance without fluff. Examples like balanced health advice, ready email templates, and detailed party plans feel supportive and efficient, just like my responses to your SQL/Power BI queries or dev troubleshooting.
​

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
   - Result: I don’t have access to your calendar, so I can’t see tomorrow’s events yet. If you paste your appointments or tell me the basics, I’ll shape it into a clear, balanced plan with prep time and buffers.
2. Prompt: What time should I leave for the airport?
   - Result: Great question—getting the timing right can make travel feel much calmer.
Quick rule of thumb:
- Domestic flight: plan to be inside the terminal 2 hours before departure.
- International flight: 3 hours before.
- Add your transit time to the airport, plus extra for parking or rental return (15–40 minutes), and a buffer for rush hour, holidays, or big airports (+20–60 minutes).
- If you have TSA PreCheck, you can usually shave 15–20 minutes off; if you’re checking bags, don’t cut it close.

A simple way to calculate leave time:
Leave time = Flight departure time − (airport arrival buffer) − (travel time to airport) − (parking/rental/transfer time) − (extra cushion for traffic/peak times)

If you want a precise time, tell me:
- Departure time and whether it’s domestic or international
- Airport
- Checked bag or carry-on only
- TSA PreCheck/Global Entry?
- How you’re getting there and how long that usually takes
- Need to park or return a rental?

I’ll do the math and set a low-stress leave time for you.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: 
No calendar/email access - Cannot view personal schedules or events, needs manual input.
No real-time data - Can't fetch live traffic, weather, or external context autonomously.
Stateless conversations - No memory between sessions; treats each query independently.
