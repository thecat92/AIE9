## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested:
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested:
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested:

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt:
   - Result:
2. Prompt:
   - Result:
3. Prompt:
   - Result:

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer:

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt:
   - Result:
2. Prompt:
   - Result:

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer:

---

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
- _describe adjustment(s) here_

##### Results:
1. _Comment here how the change(s) impacted the vibe check of your system_

    - For your initial repo setup see [00_Initial_Setup](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Initial_Setup)
    - To get the latest updates from AI Makerspace into your own AIE9 repo, run the following commands:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git push origin main
    ```
2. **IMPORTANT:** Start Cursor from the `01_Prototyping_Best_Practices_and_Vibe_Check` folder (you can also use the _File -> Open Folder_ menu option of an existing Cursor window)
3. Edit this `README.md` file (the one in your `AIE9/01_Prototyping_Best_Practices_and_Vibe_Check` folder)
4. Complete all three Activities:
    - **Activity #1:** Evaluate your system using the general vibe checking questions and define the "Aspect Tested" for each
    - **Activity #2:** Test your assistant with personal prompts it should be able to answer
    - **Activity #3:** Test your assistant with prompts requiring additional capabilities
5. Provide answers to all three Questions (`❓Question #1`, `❓Question #2`, `❓Question #3`)
6. Add, commit and push your modified `README.md` to your origin repository's main branch.

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub URL to your AIE9 repo.

### The Advanced Build:
1. Follow all of the steps (Steps 1 - 6) of the Main Assignment above
2. Document what you changed and the results you saw in the `Adjustments Made:` and `Results:` sections of the Advanced Build
3. Add, commit and push your additional modifications to this `README.md` file to your origin repository.

When submitting your homework, provide the following on the form:
+ The GitHub URL to your AIE9 repo.
+ The public Vercel URL to your updated Challenge project on your AIE9 repo.
