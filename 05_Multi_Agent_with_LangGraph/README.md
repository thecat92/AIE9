### Outline:

**BREAKOUT ROOM #1:**
- Task 1: Dependencies & Environment Setup
- Task 2: Understanding Multi-Agent Systems
- Task 3: Building a Supervisor Agent Pattern
- Task 4: Adding Tavily Search for Web Research
     - **Activity #1**: Add a Custom Specialist Agent

**BREAKOUT ROOM #2:**
- Task 5: Agent Handoffs Pattern
- Task 6: Building a Wellness Agent Team
- Task 7: Context Engineering & Optimization
- Task 8: Visualizing and Debugging with LangSmith
     - **Activity #2**: Multi-Agent Consultation Pattern

### Prerequisites:

#### 1. API Keys Required

You'll need API keys for:
- **OpenAI** - For GPT-5.2 (supervisor) and GPT-4o-mini (specialist agents)
- **Tavily** - For web search capabilities (free tier available at [tavily.com](https://www.tavily.com/))
- **LangSmith** (optional) - For tracing and debugging

### Steps to Run:

1. Install UV, which you can do through [this resource](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started)
2. Run the command `uv sync`
3. Open your Jupyter notebook and select `.venv` for your kernel.

# Build

Run the notebook!

# Ship

- Customize your multi-agent system with one of the following enhancements:
     - Add a new specialist agent to the team (e.g., a Fitness Coach, Nutrition Expert)
     - Implement a different multi-agent pattern (Network/Swarm, Debate)
     - Add human-in-the-loop approval for certain agent decisions
     - Implement context summarization to manage long conversations
- Create a diagram showing your multi-agent architecture
- Record a Loom video walking through the notebook, the questions, and your enhancements!

# Share

- Show your multi-agent architecture diagram in a Loom video and explain the agent interactions
- Make a social media post about your multi-agent wellness system and tag @AIMakerspace
- Share 3 lessons learned
- Share 3 lessons not learned

Here's a template to get your post started!

```
Built my first Multi-Agent AI System using LangGraph!

What I learned about multi-agent patterns:
1. Supervisor pattern = orchestrator that routes to specialist agents
2. Handoffs = agents can transfer control to each other based on expertise
3. Context engineering is critical - garbage in, garbage out

Key insight: Don't build multi-agents unless you really need them!
Start simple, add complexity only when necessary.

A huge shoutout to @AI Makerspace for making this possible.

<summary><h3>Advanced Build (Optional): Personal Wellness Planner with File I/O</h3></summary>

> **Note**: Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit **in place of** doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

Build a **Personal Wellness Planner** - a multi-agent system that can create, save, and manage personalized wellness plans using file system tools.

### Requirements

**1. Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- A **Planner Supervisor** (GPT-5.2) that coordinates the planning process
- Specialist agents for each wellness domain (Exercise, Nutrition, Sleep, Stress)
- A **File Manager Agent** that handles reading/writing wellness plans

**2. File System Tools:**
Create tools that allow agents to:
- `save_wellness_plan(filename, content)` - Save a plan to a markdown file
- `load_wellness_plan(filename)` - Load an existing plan
- `list_saved_plans()` - List all saved wellness plans
- `append_to_plan(filename, section, content)` - Add a section to an existing plan

**3. Workflow:**
```
