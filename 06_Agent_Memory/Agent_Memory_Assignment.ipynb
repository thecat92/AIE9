    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

      "Assistant (v1 instructions):\n",
      "Reducing stress is a great goal, and there are several effective strategies you can try. Here are some evidence-based methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It can boost your mood and improve your overall health. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deep Breathing**: Simple deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
