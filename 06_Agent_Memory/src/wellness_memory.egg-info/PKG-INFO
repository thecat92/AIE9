### Outline:

**BREAKOUT ROOM #1: Memory Foundations & LangGraph Studio**
- Task 1: Dependencies & LangGraph Studio Setup
- Task 2: Understanding Agent Memory (CoALA Framework)
- Task 3: Short-Term Memory (MemorySaver, thread_id)
- Task 4: Long-Term Memory (InMemoryStore, namespaces)
- Task 5: Message Trimming & Context Management
     - **Activity #1**: Store & Retrieve User Wellness Profile

**BREAKOUT ROOM #2: Advanced Memory & Integration**
- Task 6: Semantic Memory (Embeddings + Search)
- Task 7: Building Semantic Wellness Knowledge Base
- Task 8: Episodic Memory (Few-Shot Learning)
- Task 9: Procedural Memory (Self-Improving Agent)
- Task 10: Unified Wellness Memory Agent
     - **Activity #2**: Wellness Memory Dashboard

### Prerequisites:

#### 1. API Keys Required

You'll need API keys for:
- **OpenAI** - For GPT-5.2 and embeddings
- **LangSmith** - For tracing and debugging

Copy the sample environment file and fill in your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# Then edit .env with your actual API keys
```

#### 2. LangGraph Studio 

LangGraph Studio provides a visual interface for debugging and inspecting your memory-enabled agents:

```bash
# Run the development server (from this directory)
uv run langgraph dev
```

> NOTE: If you're on a Mac and using Chrome - you may need to enable local network access via the provided screenshot.

Features:
- Graph visualization
- State inspection at each step
- Time-travel debugging
- Memory store viewer

# Build

Run the notebook!

# Ship

- Customize your memory-enabled agent with one of the following enhancements:
     - Implement a different storage backend (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis)
     - Add memory expiration/TTL policies
     - Create a multi-user memory system with privacy controls
     - Build a memory visualization dashboard
- Create a diagram showing your memory architecture
- Record a Loom video walking through the notebook, the questions, and your enhancements!

# Share

- Show your memory architecture diagram in a Loom video and explain the memory flow
- Make a social media post about your memory-enabled wellness agent and tag @AIMakerspace
- Share 3 lessons learned
- Share 3 lessons not learned

Here's a template to get your post started!

```
Built a Memory-Enabled AI Agent using LangGraph!

What I learned about the 5 memory types:
1. Short-term = conversation context within a thread
2. Long-term = user preferences that persist across sessions
3. Semantic = facts retrieved by meaning, not exact match
4. Episodic = learning from past successful interactions
5. Procedural = self-improving instructions

Key insight: Memory is what transforms a chatbot into a true assistant!

A huge shoutout to @AI Makerspace for making this possible.

<summary><h3>Advanced Build (Optional): Multi-Agent Wellness System with Shared Memory</h3></summary>

> **Note**: Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit **in place of** doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

Build a **Multi-Agent Wellness System** where multiple specialist agents share and collaborate through a unified memory store.

### Requirements

**1. Multi-Agent Architecture:**
- **Exercise Agent**: Fitness, workouts, and physical activity guidance
- **Nutrition Agent**: Diet, meal planning, and healthy eating advice
- **Sleep Agent**: Sleep quality, insomnia, and rest optimization

**2. Memory Sharing Strategy:**
```python
# Shared namespaces (all agents can access)
(user_id, "profile")           # Long-term: User demographics, goals, conditions
("wellness", "knowledge")       # Semantic: Shared wellness knowledge base

# Per-agent namespaces (agent-specific)
("exercise_agent", "instructions")   # Procedural: Exercise agent's instructions
("exercise_agent", "episodes")       # Episodic: Successful exercise consultations
("nutrition_agent", "instructions")   # Procedural: Nutrition agent's instructions
("nutrition_agent", "episodes")       # Episodic: Successful nutrition consultations
```

**3. Cross-Agent Learning:**
- Agents can read each other's successful episodes
- Example: Nutrition agent learns from Exercise agent's approach for users with injuries
- Shared user profile ensures consistency across all agents

**4. Workflow:**
```
User: "I want to lose weight but I have a knee injury"

```

**5. Memory Dashboard:**
Create a simple dashboard (can be text-based or use Streamlit) that shows:
- Current user profile
- Recent memories from each agent
- Cross-agent memory sharing statistics
- Memory search interface

### Bonus Features (optional)
- Implement memory conflict resolution when agents store conflicting information
- Add memory importance scoring (prioritize memories that are frequently accessed)
- Create a memory cleanup routine that removes stale or low-value memories
- Implement memory compression for long-running sessions

### Resources
- [LangGraph Memory Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/)
- [CoALA Framework Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)
